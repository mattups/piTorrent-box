# piTorrent-box
Configuring a Raspberry Pi with Transmission and a network shared folder, the easy way.

# Usage
As you can see, this setup is split into three files:
* piT-box-network.sh
* piT-box-storage.sh
* piT-box-transmission.sh

Each script will help you through the process of configuring and setting up the system in order to have a nice and simple torrent-box with a web-based interface and a network shared folder.

Of course, don't forget to set permissions on these file to make them executable. For example:

`chmod +x piT-box-network.sh`

and then:

`./piT-box-network.sh`
